# E-Mess
## 🚀 Problem Statement

Our college hostel mess had a traditional reservation system for reserving tokens for special Non-Vegetarian foods, eggs and much more delightful dishes. For getting the token, the students had to

- Wait in a large queue that is larger than a plane's wing 😑
- If they are reserved one, they should keep it very safely to issue the food during the time of eating
- Difficulty in reusing the token if reserved and not used
- Can't return the token after reservation, if the student has changed the mind to not to eat that day
  - More reasons will be updated in the future 😁

## 👑 The Solution (Abra ka dabra)

- Created a Web App that acts as a **PWA(Progressive Web Application)**
  - **PWA** is a technology that makes a normal web application look like a native mobile application.
  - With PWA, we can have access to native mobile application modules 😁
- The main idea is, the app is seperated into client and admin part
  - The client can see the menu, reserve/cancel tokens
  - The admin can see the number of token registrations, cross-check and dynamically change the data.
